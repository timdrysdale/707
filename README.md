Saturday - 11 races, confused winds ~10knots-ish, Inverkeithing bay## Largs Event Oct 9/10 EASTLANDER


Tide goes out the middle of the channel, and comes in round the edges of the bay, so different strengths in different places on ebb compared to flow.

rig on Loos gauage 16 inners, 22 outers - maybe too tight for say


Sunday

same rig but too much forestay sag in the stronger winds (obviously).


Sharp turn in the heavy wind when you find a flat sea spot
Need to avoid slamming into the waves - kills momentum
Crank main on, keep boom centre - seems faster.
Do not pinch!
Needs time to come up to speed.

Downwind - turn up to fill spinnaker, turn down in gusts. Faster on a broad reach than downwind. So Gybe rather than go straight downwind. In a heavier wind cam do more straight down as might get pushed over on a reach in a gust.

windward drops take a minute more, especially with four, so if choosing leeward gate, give crew plenty of time (esp if changing plan and there is an issue with something).

Adjusting the halyards, outhaul on every leg - pit man, with markings for light and heavy wind.

Marking on pole downhaul for how tight in to prevent it swinging back

usage of half tweakers

Can fly kite without the pole, obvs, as needed for quick gybes.

Gybeing - slow rotation of boat, i.e. big circle, don't turn too far up.

Tacking, probably need a bigger circle (else stops the boat)

Boat needs momentum at start, so don't accelerate from standstill - come in going for it - but not from the barging zone.

Revise rule 18 - do not try for the inside with no overlap - even if it looks like there is a gap, it WILL shut on you as the boat(s) round up.

Must sheet out to bear away in heavier winds- watch out when ducking -  but in lighter winds can gybe before start keeping the main in.

Want more twist in mainsail off the wind, so traveller up, mainsail out

Brace on the feet strips ...

Traveller -needs to be long enough rope to pull it up in 2-4 yanks, not apollos 12 yanks.

Cunningham - needed this on the windy day.

Use inland-side channel round tyre barrier if in doubt.

Engines tend to quit on the club boats, so keep a sail up if you can (jib only if downwind into the berth)

If in irons in a big wind with just the main up, can get it going backwards pretty easily - snatchy tiller at this point. Getting out of irons and getting way on is a slow process - fell to each side a few times. Holding head to wind with main to sort jib gave only a few seconds - need plenty of speed to keep the drift on.

Sailed ok with broken batten - duck tape patch over the batten break point hole did not really help much as came off. Battern popped out needed putting back in with some tools to push it.

BRING - adjustable spanner, loos gauge, screw driver, duck tape, permanent pen.

Jib - use two separate sheets to keep mark position consistent. 

Mark on main and jib - useful to see mark appearing between final pulley and the boom, you can eyeball how high up the rope it is. There is not one setting for all winds. Did end up pulling it all the way through.

Put cross marks on deck for all adjustments to match markers. mark the rotation of the winches.

Apollo - need to sort the pole holder on the boom - better 150mm pipe section.
Need to lift the downhall over the top of the pole when stowed, so it doesn't snag on the winch.

Lots of outhaul was on ... sail was quite tight.

With just 4people, reefed, in 30knots, was flapping the whole main and broaching still. Went a bit better in lulls with sail cranked in and not pinching too much ... so if racing in heavy weather, it might actually handle gusts better if already powered up and driving ahead??


On the startline, do not expect to barge. There will be no gap. Boats got snarled up in this. Better to get in the queue, behind boats, not coming in from the side, or duck across and look for a clear spot. Clear air matters more in a sprint race. Also choosing least busy gate made a difference for the race winners. From 15th to 4th in one leg as a result of avoiding trouble.

### Sail shape

CHRU were twisted off and making better VMG on saturday.
