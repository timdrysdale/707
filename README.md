no fifth.

Saturday - 11 races, confused winds ~10knots-ish, Inverkeithing bay## Largs Event Oct 9/10 EASTLANDER


Tide goes out the middle of the channel, and comes in round the edges of the bay, so different strengths in different places on ebb compared to flow.

rig on Loos gauage 16 inners, 22 outers - maybe too tight for say


Sunday

same rig but too much forestay sag in the stronger winds (obviously).


Sharp turn in the heavy wind when you find a flat sea spot
Need to avoid slamming into the waves - kills momentum
Crank main on, keep boom centre - seems faster.
Do not pinch!
Needs time to come up to speed.

Downwind - turn up to fill spinnaker, turn down in gusts. Faster on a broad reach than downwind. So Gybe rather than go straight downwind. In a heavier wind cam do more straight down as might get pushed over on a reach in a gust.

windward drops take a minute more, especially with four, so if choosing leeward gate, give crew plenty of time (esp if changing plan and there is an issue with something).

Adjusting the halyards, outhaul on every leg - pit man, with markings for light and heavy wind.

Marking on pole downhaul for how tight in to prevent it swinging back

usage of half tweakers

Can fly kite without the pole, obvs, as needed for quick gybes.

Gybeing - slow rotation of boat, i.e. big circle, don't turn too far up.

Tacking, probably need a bigger circle (else stops the boat)

Boat needs momentum at start, so don't accelerate from standstill - come in going for it - but not from the barging zone.

Revise rule 18 - do not try for the inside with no overlap - even if it looks like there is a gap, it WILL shut on you as the boat(s) round up.

Must sheet out to bear away in heavier winds- watch out when ducking -  but in lighter winds can gybe before start keeping the main in.

Want more twist in mainsail off the wind, so traveller up, mainsail out

Brace on the feet strips ...

Traveller -needs to be long enough rope to pull it up in 2-4 yanks, not apollos 12 yanks.

Cunningham - needed this on the windy day.

Use inland-side channel round tyre barrier if in doubt.

Engines tend to quit on the club boats, so keep a sail up if you can (jib only if downwind into the berth)

If in irons in a big wind with just the main up, can get it going backwards pretty easily - snatchy tiller at this point. Getting out of irons and getting way on is a slow process - fell to each side a few times. Holding head to wind with main to sort jib gave only a few seconds - need plenty of speed to keep the drift on.

Sailed ok with broken batten - duck tape patch over the batten break point hole did not really help much as came off. Battern popped out needed putting back in with some tools to push it.

BRING - adjustable spanner, loos gauge, screw driver, duck tape, permanent pen.

Jib - use two separate sheets to keep mark position consistent. 

Mark on main and jib - useful to see mark appearing between final pulley and the boom, you can eyeball how high up the rope it is. There is not one setting for all winds. Did end up pulling it all the way through.

Put cross marks on deck for all adjustments to match markers. mark the rotation of the winches.

Apollo - need to sort the pole holder on the boom - better 150mm pipe section.
Need to lift the downhall over the top of the pole when stowed, so it doesn't snag on the winch.

Lots of outhaul was on ... sail was quite tight.

With just 4people, reefed, in 30knots, was flapping the whole main and broaching still. Went a bit better in lulls with sail cranked in and not pinching too much ... so if racing in heavy weather, it might actually handle gusts better if already powered up and driving ahead??


On the startline, do not expect to barge. There will be no gap. Boats got snarled up in this. Better to get in the queue, behind boats, not coming in from the side, or duck across and look for a clear spot. Clear air matters more in a sprint race. Also choosing least busy gate made a difference for the race winners. From 15th to 4th in one leg as a result of avoiding trouble.

### Sail shape

CHRU were twisted off and making better VMG on saturday.

### Notes on sprint slams from Emil 

Sprints 2021 notes: 
### Helm 
Just after rounding windward mark don't bear-away to much as we are losing speed and we had lots of boats going on the top of us - passing us on the windward side and they were going faster. Especially important in lights winds. 
When you do sharp turn at the windward mark and move ruder a lot you are killing speed. 
When tacking turn rudder first slow and smooth and then second half of the turn faster. 
In light winds after rounding windward mark stay up - you will help spinnaker to fill with air quicker and we will have it flying quicker. Especially important in light winds. 
You can also help with spinnaker drop by ensuring you not sitting on the guy line :-) 

#### Bow 
Try to keep spinnaker pole forward when hoisting spinnaker so it is not going back to much when guy is pulled or pit get the pole downhaul tight - it will keep pole forward and prevent it from going back. We need to mark downhaul line. 
If there is a twist in sip after the hoist shout back to the sheet and guy guys so they are aware there is a twist... and drop spinnaker halyard a meter or so and realise halyard more if the twist is not despairing... sometimes I was letting halyard go some 5 meters to get twist sorted but spi sheet and guy have to help to. 
We do have at the mast optional cleat like most of other boats but we also have a little cord-rope attached next to the cleat to keep spi halyard not coming of the cleat and flaying back behind the shrouds. 
See pit note regarding windward spi drops we are dropping through the clutch so make sure you have spi halyard off the mast cleat. 

#### Pit 
When pre-feeding guy make sure the guy line attached to the spi clew is not wrapped at the shrouds. We do have one spinnaker sheet line spliced and ordered the other one it will arrive tomorrow ðŸ˜Š Thursday. 
Remember to keep jib sheet under the spi lines when approaching windward mark before spinnaker hoist. 
Immediately after the spi hoist is done uphaul and downhaul very often needs adjustments - it is your job pit!  
When guy is pulled in and pole goes back let out some downhaul so we don't get the pole mast end broken again (we had quite a few broken) 
When on spir keep your eye on kicker line especially when is blowing and be ready to let it out.
When we drop spinnaker on windward pit is to let out the spi halyard through the clatch.Â  
and spi sheet (big Pawel) is to help guy (Emil) on the windward side. At that time bow is putting spi pole back on starboard side of the boom as we always drop on port at least when course is set properly. Bow be quick with putting pole back as we may need to gybe! 
Cunningham outhall and kicker have to be let out at windward mark. When is blowing helm may find difficult bearing away if you don't let them out. 

#### Main/guy 
When dropping spi when is blowing hard make sure guy line goes out smoothly. 
You are the tactician you will be taking to other boats so do not use aggressive English swear in 
Polish and only when you have to :-) hahaha... 
At the marks negotiate with other boats early. Do not wait. At 3 boat length from mark tell them you have overlap and tell the ones that don't have overlap with you that they don't have a mark room and do not let them inside. 
If we need to tack have a look around and behind to.Â  

#### All 
It will be good if we could call the gusts... that is really making the difference to helm and main sheet man. 
When you sit on the rail give feedback how we are doing compared to others... are we slow are they point higher. 
When spi is flying bow can help with looking back and helping the strategy as main sheet/ tactician will be on the guy. 
Our wee Pawel - pit is more advanced then the spinnaker sheet - big Pawel so pit will be givingÂ spinnaker sheet lots of feedback to help trim the spi and we may need to swap spi sheet with spi guy person (big Pawel with Emil) 

#### Other
no jib sheets cross winching at start 
main problem on Eastlander was up wind performance. This could be because we like to oversheet and often we end up very tight. 
or it can be because our jib is not in great shape anymore and so is main :-(  or it can be because we are going to high and not have good speed... first speed then pointing. 
Tim our tiller extension is not as long as on Apollo but is long enough so you can seat well forward and help with ballast.Â  

#### What we perhaps do differently to others:
- in a strong winds our pit (wee Pawel) will trim jib sheets as he is only 55kg compared with big Pawel 100kg so we rather have wee Pawel going off the rails... and he is more experienced so presumably he would sheet jib better. We also have way where we sheet jib from the rails (that is when cross winching) 
- roll tacks are great in light winds and we do them but lets tray roll gybes :-) 
- when dropping spi on windward side we rather not fly the spi to long with no pole as we find that without pole will only fly in some 15 degrees boat to wind angle and very often this is not the course helm wants to go. 

#### Other issues:
Tim we were also racing with Justin this Sunday (me and big Pawel) Wind was blowing like crazy very similar to what we had on Sunday at Sprints but the vawe was bigger. We noted that Justin had his jib top and middle tell tiles flaying up (pinching) most of the time - so a correction to what I said before - pinching in big vawes is ok. Make sure the bottom tile tails are flying properly. 

I may have lots wrong here so correct me - I am still learning. 
What a great sport you can learn whole live! :-)

#### big wave pointing 

Re pinching in big waves, might be more that the jib was twisted off more for better acceleration after each wave collision, and hence at a good angle to sail upwind, the top of jib was stalled (telltales lifting) but the lower, larger region of jib was still driving powerfully (tell tales flowing). Probably n bigger wind we just have the cars all the way back anyway, and manage as best we can with the sheet tension. With jib leech telltale we can check if jib too far in and closing off the gap. We want it in as far as possible, so tighten til leech tell tales stall/suck back, then ease 1/4-1/2inch til flowing again. Varies with windspeed. ( Also Saturday we might go out depowered for the morning F6/7 but then need to remember power up as it drops to F5 after the morning blow is over, of course forecast will probably change!)

## Largs Event Oct 9/10 EASTLANDER

Bow - Steve Thomson
Spinnaker Sheet  Big Pawel
Pit - Wee Pawel
Main sheet/guy - Emil
Helm - Tim 

### Heavy winds
Comment in [review](https://www.boats.com/reviews/madforsailing-test-hunter-707/)
"In a breeze, not having a backstay made it a bit of a drama upwind, as there's no easy way to flatten the mainsail by bending the mast. [...] For the record, we felt the best way to get upwind in a blow was by powering up the bottom of the mainsail and using a combination of sheet, traveller and vang to twist off the top."


### Pre-event plans

Boat in Friday afternoon, mast up 2pm with help from other Crews. Tim and Steve to arrive mid afternoon (work constraints)

### Post event plans

Windy for boat transport to Rhu - suggest spare sails to avoid flogging race sails in F7 gusts (if forecast stays as it is). Since from west, will ease as get into Gareloch, perhaps by as much as 10 knots.
